<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hyperspace travel is a cool and fast way to get around. However, recent studies have investigated the potential shortcomings of this method and findings are surprisingly uninteresting. This article aims to list the potential risks associated with hyperspace travel in an absurdly uncaring manner.</p>

<h1>Posttravel dementia</h1>
<p>During hyperspace travel, great distances can be covered in a matter of seconds. The current record for the so-called <it>intergalactic burger run</it> with a proud distance of 7.21 parsecs (approx 23.5 lightyears) is held by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaphod_Beeblebrox">Zaphood Beeblebrox</a> at 4.83 seconds. &nbsp;
Due to this massive velocity and the well-documented laziness of thoughts, it is not uncommon for thoughts to refuse to accompany the respective thinker during the journey. This can result in a noticeable loss of memory, which is why hyperspace travellers are adviced to think about trivial things, such as lullabies for Marsian children or the meaning of life, as they make the jump into hyperspace. &nbsp;
It should be noted that hyperspace travellers have attempted to use posttravel dementia to forget about uncomfortable social situations, but the literature hints at this method being largely unreliable. &nbsp;

<h1>Disappearing of food items</h1>
<p>It has been postulated that the octodimensional denizens of hyperspace, while peaceful, will at times steal certain food items from hyperspace travellers. This includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
  <li>Dark Roast Arrabica Coffee Beans</li>
  <li>Gluten-free Fettuccine</li>
  <li>Strawberries omitting a light with wavelengths of less than 630nm</li>
  <li>Single gummy bears</li>
</ul>
Several methods to prevent this can be implemented:
<ol>
  <li>Store food in safe compartments such as hyperspace-resistent sandwich bags</li>
  <li>Use food colouring on strawberries to change their apparent colour</li>
  <li>Consume food items prior to departing</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Disregarding minor inconveniences such as potentially forgetting a relative's birthday or having to rebuy Dark Roast Arrabica Coffee Beans at your destination, hyperspace travel is a safe and cheap way to travel between galaxies. It is especially attractive for commuters, as having to travel dozens of lightyears in a day is rather unpleasant with conventional methods and requires the use of non-linear space time, which means that  it is impossible to watch the local football derby live on the way home.</p>
